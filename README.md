# NPR-factory 
  
  NPR stands for [non-photorealistic rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering)

  This is a little demo of a hand draw art style I created with shaders which I might make into a game eventually. All of the hatching and coloring are procedurally generated from the meshes. There are a few working game mechanics but most of the work was on the shaders and art.

  Sadly, this does not work on some browsers since it requires webgl 2.0
