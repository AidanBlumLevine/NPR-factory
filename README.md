  NPR stands for [non-photorealistic rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering)

  This is a little demo of a hand draw art style I created with shaders which I might make into a game eventually. All of the hatching and coloring are procedurally generated from flat colored meshes. There are no textures used. 

  Sadly, this does not work on some browsers since it requires webgl 2.0
