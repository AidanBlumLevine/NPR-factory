  NPR stands for [non-photorealistic rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering)

  This is a little demo of an art style I created with shaders which I might make into a game eventually. There are a few working game mechanics but most of the work was on the shaders and art.
